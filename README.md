# Hidden Papa
React Native application for a word guessing + social deductive game.

The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word and also identify the Hidden Papa.

In each round, players are randomly separated into 3 roles: Game Master, Hidden Papa, and Guesser.
The Game Master is given 3 words and must select a word. The selected word is then revealed to the Hidden Papa.
The remaining guessers have no idea what the word is. No one knows who each other's role is except for the Game
Master.

The next phase is the guessing phase, where the Guessers take turns asking the Game Master yes-or-no questions
in order to find out the hidden word. The Hidden Papa must blend in with the Guessers and help them find the
word. Remember, only the Game Master and Hidden Papa know what the word is at the beginning of the round. There's
also a time limit, so guess fast. If the time runs out, everyone loses, but if the word is guessed in time, the
final phase begins.

The final phase is the voting phase, where all players, including the Game Master, must cast a vote on who they
think the Hidden Papa is. That is why it is important for the Hidden Papa to subtly lead the guessers to the right
word without giving themselves away. If the majority of the votes goes to the Hidden Papa, then the Guessers and
Game Master wins! Otherwise, the Hidden Papa wins! The amount of time it took to guess the word
is the amount of time given to vote, so make sure to cast your vote before the time expires!
